      <description>This weeks Tidy Tuesday challenge centred around Spotify data, over 32,000 songs from multiple genres from the 60s to today. Given this was my first Tidy Tuesday for a while I decided to go for something relatively quick and simple to try to get back into the habit and look at the popularity of different types of music over time.
Code Having read in the data the next step was to make a quick modification to allow me to work with dates as opposed to character values.</description>
